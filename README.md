# Smile_Simulation

FIRST THING TO BE DONE
        ** Must have gazebo desktop installed!
        If you do not have huskey_gazebo please install with the following
        command:
        
                sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-husky-simulator

        Initialize your environment:
                sudo ./init.sh

Contents of the repo:
        Under media you will find materials, scripts, and textures. You must run
        init.sh after adding textures, editing scripts, or even editing world.
        The script will copy all the contexts of those files into their rightful
        location in gazebo.
